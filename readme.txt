A. first i will do the design in html and css to have a guide on the structure before doing the javascript functions.
FOR HTML AND CSS
1. i will create a monochrome gradient background theme (that will also change when the song is changed if i'll have more time).
2. then the music player box. 
3. then the content of the music player 
  -details of the music/song currently playing
    - album cover, 
    - song title, 
    - artist/singer.
    - audio (will not show in the browser)
4. then the control and navigation buttons
    - seek bar
        - duration 
            - current-time
            - total duration
        - seek slider
    - previous, play/pause, next buttons
    - volume control
        - volume up
        - volume slider
        - volume down

FOR THE javascript functions and implementations**mostly with the help of research-this is my weak point so far
1. create an object first for all the elements that will be needed from the html.
2. then the functions
    - change of visual for play and pause buttons
    - audio details
    - seekbar current time value
    - change in tract (previous and next)
    - volume change
